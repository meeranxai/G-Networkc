# Phase 6: Comprehensive Enhancements

This phase focuses on deepening the functionality of the core features we've built, making them more robust and "feature-complete" compared to major social platforms.

## Steps

1.  **Chat Upgrades**
    - [ ] **Message Replies**: Implement the ability to swipe or click a message to "Reply" to it (Quoted replies).
    - [ ] **Group Typing Indicators**: Show specific names (e.g., "Alex is typing...") instead of generic text.
    - [ ] **Status Indicators**: Show a green dot in the chat header if the user is currently online.

2.  **Social Feed Polish**
    - [ ] **Image Lightbox**: Clicking a post image should open it in a full-screen modal with zoom/close.
    - [ ] **Share Functionality**: Add a "Share" button that copies the direct link to the post (requires routing updates) or reposts it.

3.  **Profile Developer Features**
    - [ ] **Tech Stack Tags**: Add a section in `profile.html` and `profile-social.js` to add/edit tags like "React", "Node.js", "Python".
    - [ ] **Joined Date**: Display "Member since [Date]" on the profile card.

4.  **Global UX**
    - [ ] **Toast System**: Unify all alerts (currently some native alerts) to use the custom Toast Notification system.
